Take a look at the list of movies in the database!  Once they have displayed on your screen, you can toggle the eyeball to annotate if you have seen it or not.

Blue indicates you have not seen it, gold means that you have.  Click any title to search an expansive list of movies related to it.  Once inside the details page, you can click on the heart to add it to the "watch later" list.
