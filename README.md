Take a look at the list of movies in the database!  Once they have displayed on your screen, you can toggle the eyeball to annotate if you have seen it or not.

Blue indicates you have not seen it, gold means that you have.  Click any title to search an expansive list of movies related to it.  Once inside the details page, you can click on the heart to add it to the "watch later" list.

The API has been having issues.  Sometimes, the details page will properly load, and some other times it won't load at all and instead give an error indicating reading null.  This is due to the fetch being rejected (sending too many requests).
